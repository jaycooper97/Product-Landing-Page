    <h2 id="footer">How to Use a Comfort Blanket</h2>
    <p>You want to use the Comfort Blanket as a regular blanket; cover your entire body with it, and lay down in a comforting spot.  You can cover your head with the blanket, or leave your head out, and at this point, you'll want to start practicing your deep breathing.  You can use other coping mechanisims too, like wrapping yourself in the blanket, and drinking a hot cup of tea.  This will not only make you feel like someone is holding you, but the steam from the tea will keep your airways open, and drinking the tea will help you control your breathing.</p>

    <h2 id="coping">Coping Exercises to Try</h2>
    <p>There are many ways you can cope, and you can mix and match them together to create the perfect self-care routine.  I have a list of some of my favorite ways to keep calm and smile on.</p>
    <br>
        <p>Whenever I feel anxious or depressed, I do some deep breathing techniques while using aroma therapy scents, such as jasmine, lavender, and other calming smells.  Also, when I'm in a state where I'm struggling to breathe, I take sips of water or hot tea to get my breaths under control.</p>  
            <p>If I'm ever stuck in a ruminating cycle of replaying negative thoughts in my mind, I put an ice cube in my hand to quickly bring me back to the present moment.  I even write my feelings in a journal; it's a healthier and easier way for me to express how I feel without necessarily speaking to someone (in case I don't have anyone to speak to at the moment).</p>
    <br>
    <p>These techniques combined with a Comfort Blanket is the perfect way to get yourself relaxed.  Not only are they healthy ways to cope, but they work in a matter of minutes!  It's a reasonably quick, easy, and safe way to keep yourself at an even level.</p>
